# OpenSphere
Open source Godot engine recreation of the flash game Rainbow Sphere by Tim van Helsdingen.  Licensed under GPLv3.

This is a direct dump of the project folder from Godot 3.1.1 on my computer.  To edit this project, I'm pretty sure you can just download the entire directory and throw it in your Godot projects directory locally.
